# Assets Required

## Critical: Licence Card Background Image

The licence card section requires a background image asset named:
**`licence_card_background`**

### How to Add:

1. Open Xcode project
2. Right-click on project → "Add Files to DigitalID..."
3. Select your background image file
4. Make sure "Copy items if needed" is checked
5. Add to target "DigitalID"
6. In the image asset, name it exactly: `licence_card_background`

### Current Fallback:

The code currently uses a light green background with diagonal pattern as fallback until the image is added.

### Image Specifications (from mockup):
- Light green background with diagonal stripe pattern
- Should match the exact visual from the mockup
- Used in the licence card section behind photo and QR panel
